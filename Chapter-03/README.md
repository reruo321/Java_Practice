                       ┌ boolean (1bit)                     ├ short (16bit, signed)
    1. Primitive Type -│                 ┌ Integral Type ---├ int   (32bit, signed)
                       │                 │                  ├ long  (64bit, signed)
                       └ Numeric Type ---│                  └ char  (16bit, signed, UTF-16)

                                         └ Floating Point Type -┬ float  (32bit, single-precision)
                                                                └ double (64bit, double-precision)
