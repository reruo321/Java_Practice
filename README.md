# Java_Practice

Personal Projects for Java Practice

I use JDK 1.8 this time, and the book I used to study is "새롭게 시작하는 Java Programming" by 이우진, 김홍섭.

※ Warning!!! Some examples may be different from the original codes, since I sometimes manage to write a program by looking only a main method AND an execution result. (To practice by myself)
