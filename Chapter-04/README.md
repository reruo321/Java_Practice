# Ch. 4 - Control Flow Statement & Array

## Control Flow Statement
Statement(ë¬¸) is a syntactic unit of an imperative programming language (programming paradigm using statements to change a program's state) that expresses some action to be carried out.

    ;   // null statement (or empty statement)
    int a = 10;   // simple statement
    return 0;   // simple statement
    if (a == 10) return 0;   // compound statement
    
Control flow is the order of imperative program to execute or evaluate its statements, instructions, or function calls. Conditional statement handles the flow with its evaluation, true or false, for the condition.
"If-then-else" and "Case and Switch" are the examples for this.

### If-then-else
Most known high-level programming languages like C/C++ and Java have if-then-else statements as one of the key elements of structed programming.
#### If-then
    /* Example 1 */
    int a = 11;
    if(a % 2 != 0){   // If 'a' is an odd number, run "{...}". True.
        System.out.println("Odd input!");
        a--;
    }
    System.out.println(a + " is even.");

    /* Example 2 */
    int b = 11;
    if(b % 2 != 0)   // If 'b' is an odd number, run "b--;". True.
        b--;         
    System.out.println(b + " is even.");

Example 1 makes an odd variable 'a' to run statements in the nested block. (Nested block: parenthesized statements by curly brackets {}.)

If you want just one simple statement being only accessed by true evaluation, you can write it right after "if" without any brackets. In the second example, if a variable 'b' is odd, the condition is true so it triggers "b--;" and then "System.out.println(b);". However, even 'b' will result in a false evaluation, and "b--;" will not work either, but will instead run "System.out.println(b);".

If you want multiple conditions for one if-then, use logical operators to control them.

    int age = 14;
    if(age > 7 && age < 18)   // If a boy's age is between 7 ~ 18, prevent him from playing Call of Duty.
        System.out.println("Oh, no! You can't play Call of Duty yet. Play Minecraft instead.")

#### If-else
