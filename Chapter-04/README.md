# Ch. 4 - Control Flow Statement & Array

## Control Flow Statement
Statement(ë¬¸) is a syntactic unit of an imperative programming language (programming paradigm using statements to change a program's state) that expresses some action to be carried out.

    ;   // null statement (or empty statement)
    int a = 10;   // simple statement
    return 0;   // simple statement
    if (a == 10) return 0;   // compound statement
    
Conditional statement handles the flow of the the program with its evaluation for the condition, true or false.
I'll introduce "If-then-else" and "Case and Switch" as some of the examples.
