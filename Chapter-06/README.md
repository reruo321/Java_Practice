# Ch. 6 - Inheritance
1. Single Inheritance: The basic form of inheritance; a class extends another one class.
2. Multiple Inheritance: A class extending more than one base class, which should manage the dependency of its multiple classes. Most of the new object-oriented languages like Java and C# do not provide multiple inheritance, whereas C++ does.
3. Multilevel Inheritance: A class extending another one class is a parent of the other class.
4. Hierarchical Inheritance: A class having many children.
5. Hybrid Inheritance: Single + Multiple inheritance. Since multiple inheritance is not supported directly in Java, the hybrid can be done through interfaces only.
