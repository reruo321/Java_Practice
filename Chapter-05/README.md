# Ch. 5 - Class and Object
Java is an Object-Oriented Programming language. It can reuse its codes, and it has good modularity, flexibility, maintenance, cost cutting, and troubleshooting. There are four main characteristics of Object-Oriented Progamming.
1. Abstraction: Outlines general traits of several objects. For example, three objects "dog", "cat", and "pig" are the animals having their ears and legs. They can also sleep, eat, and cry.
2. Encapsulation: Data and operators encapsulated by class units can be either public or private.
3. Inheritance: Subclass (child) can be derived from superclass(parent), getting its features. Most of the new object-oriented languages like Java and C# do not provide multiple inheritance, whereas C++ does. (Details are on Chapter 6.)
4. Polymorphism: Multiple forms are allowed for an interface, or a method.
