# Character Encoding
**Character encoding** is the process of assigning numbers to graphical characters, and enables them to be stored, transmitted, and transformed using digital computers.

## ASCII
**ASCII**(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard for electronic communication.
The standard is **7-bit** codes, and it has an extended version of 8-bit. (Extended ASCII)
### Control Characters
ASCII takes the first 32 codes (decimal 0~31) and 0x7F for control characters.
They are originally not to print information, but rather to control devices.
The last ASCII code 0x7F, "delete"(DEL), is included here, although it is far from other control characters numerically.

### Printable Characters
ASCII codes 20 (32) to 7E (126) in hex are printable characters.
