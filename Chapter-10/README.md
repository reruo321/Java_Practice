# Ch. 10 - Java GUI Program

## AWT
AWT(Abstract Window Toolkit) is a package of components for programming GUI programs in Java.
It provides various things as default, including components such as menu, button, list, checkbox, and text area, and also containers for them like window and panel.
There are classes to edit the font or color of components, or to process events for them.

## Swing
Swing is a widget toolkit to provide more enhanced GUI embodiment than AWT. It has Swing components most of which are similar to those of AWT.

1. Swing does not require allocation of native resources in the OS's windowing toolkit unlike AWT, but instead Java renders graphics directly.
2. Swing has more complicated and various graphic components like table and tree.
3. Swing provides Look and Feel function; by using it a user can modify program's entire UI.
4. Swing components are platform-independent and lightweight, without using Native methods.
