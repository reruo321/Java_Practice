This is the calculator whose UI resembles the program from old Windows, but miscellaneous controls try to follow that of Windows 10.

### Number
Numbers in the calculator are BigDecimal, and the displayed one has maximum 16 as scale. (Scale is the number of the digits to the right of the decimal point. For example, the scale of a BigDecimal "12.345" would be 3, and "3.00000" would be 5.)
